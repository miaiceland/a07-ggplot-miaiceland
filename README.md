# Activity: ggplot - Bicycle Sharing

## Instructions 

- Each student will submit the activity individually to Canvas, but students are encouraged to help one another complete the work
- Complete the questions in A07-template.Rmd, which are loosely based on the Bicycle Sharing Activity found in the DataComputing eBook
    - make sure you carefully follow the instructions and mirror the code in the A07-template.Rmd document as you work. It is different than the project in the text book.
    - **make sure to complete the narritive texts explaining the plots when you are asked to do so**
    - you should make commits in GitHub as you complete the activity
- submit the completed RMarkdown file and RNotebook to Canvas before due date.
- Remember to push to GitHub.

## Warning

The data are slightly larger for this activity when compared to most of the others.  You'll have more than ~10,00 rows of data and several variables, so be aware that some of your functions (especially the joins) may take a minute or two to run.
